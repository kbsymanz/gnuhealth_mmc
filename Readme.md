# Gnuhealth_mmc

A custom Gnuhealth module for a large charity maternity clinic in the Philippines. This module is specifically designed for one particular clinic, though anyone can use parts or all of it freely as you see fit. See license for details. Use at your own risk - there is no warranty.

Currently using GnuHealth 1.6.4, but will be upgrading to 1.8.x soon.

Comments, suggestions, and pull requests are welcome. Would love to see this be used for more than just one clinic so your input is appreciated.
